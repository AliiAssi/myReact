## Project Report: Shopify 

### Overview

In this project, I implemented a clone of the popular Shopify platform, named "Shopify" using modern web technologies and best practices. The project utilizes a fake API for product data, which can be accessed at [https://dummyjson.com/](https://dummyjson.com/).

### Technologies Used

- **React**: Employed with the Vite plugin for fast development and build processes.
- **React Router DOM**: Implemented for routing strategy to manage navigation between different views.
- **React Icons**: Utilized for professional and intuitive icon-based navigation.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Applied for efficient state management across the application.
- **Local Storage**: Used to store user data and other relevant information, accessible via the browser’s developer tools.
